## Welcome to Dima's GitHub Page

This collection houses my Python programming and data analysis projects.

### Projects

**DanceItRobit:** To increase my Python coding skills, I was gifted with a coding robot. I wanted to challenge myself to create an advanced program that utilized the robot's full capabilities, my music background, and some rigorous OOP. The result is this program, which abstracts pitch/keyboard creation and inputs a user's musical motifs. The output is a robot's artistic expression through song and postmodern contact-improvisation industrial dance.

**PoemGenny:** This demonstrates a Python workflow that generates a poem by scraping a website, then selecting, organizing, and modifying word text.  Output is then saved to a file, thus archiving poetry of such...epic, fulsome, magnitude that this code has been banned from the Vogsphere.  Try it out for yourself!

  - Example output:

*all books to classics? 'mystery' scr-scra-scraped* 

*all books to up? 'contemporary' par-pare-parenting* 

*sapiens brief requiem science! 'biography' war-warn-warning*

*...ibertarianis... ...bertariani... ...ertarian...*

**NutritionAnalysisTour:** This project takes a single .csv file -- Starbucks drink menu nutrition information -- and embarks upon an analysis tour, utilizing multiple programs and methods:  
 
 | Method | Language / tool | Status |
| :----------- | :----------- | :----------- |
| Data cleaning  | Python (Pandas)     | Complete  |
| Descriptive statistics  | Python (Pandas)   | In progress |
| Relational database creation | Pandas, PostgreSQL  | Up next |
| Relational database queries | PostgreSQL  | To do |
| Optimization algorithm | Python  | To do |
| Inferential statistics | R  | To do |
| Data visualization | Tableau  | To do |
