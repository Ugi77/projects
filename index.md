## Welcome to Dima's GitHub Page

This collection houses my Python programming and data analysis projects.


**NutritionAnalysisTour:** This project takes a single .csv file -- Starbucks drink menu nutrition information -- through a series of analysis workflows, utilizing multiple methods:

**PoemGenny:** This Python workflow generates a poem by scraping a website, then selecting, organizing, and modifying word text.  Output is then saved to a file, thus archiving poetry of such...epic, fulsome, magnitude that this code has been banned from the Vogsphere.  Try it out for yourself!
  - [Code](https://github.com/Ugi77/projects/tree/main/PoemGenny)
  - Example output:

*all books to classics? 'mystery' scr-scra-scraped* 

*all books to up? 'contemporary' par-pare-parenting* 

*sapiens brief requiem science! 'biography' war-warn-warning*

*...ibertarianis... ...bertariani... ...ertarian...*

**DanceItRobit:** To increase my Python coding skills, I was gifted with a coding robot. I wanted to challenge myself to create an advanced program that utilized the robot's full capabilities, my music background, and some rigorous OOP. The result is this program, which abstracts pitch/keyboard creation and inputs a user's musical motifs. The output is a robot's artistic expression through song and postmodern contact-improvisation industrial dance.
