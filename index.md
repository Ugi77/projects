### Projects

 + **DanceItRobit:** To increase my Python coding skills, I was gifted with a coding robot. I wanted to challenge myself to create an advanced program that utilized the robot's full capabilities, my music background, and some rigorous OOP. The result is this program, which abstracts pitch/keyboard creation and inputs a user's musical motifs. The output is a robot's artistic expression through song and postmodern contact-improvisation industrial dance.
